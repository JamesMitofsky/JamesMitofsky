## What I do üé∏
When not studying political science or playing music, I love working on web-development. What's more, as could only be the case in the 21st century, I'm focused on the JAMstack and writing serverless functions.

## What I'm working on ‚ú®
I've been projecting [unwaitlist.io](https://unwaitlist.io/) (a service for UVM students) since late 2019, but I'm currently looking to switch stacks from Azure to Firebase. I also recently bought a Tessel 2, so I'm looking forward to seeing my code manifest itself in the physical world.

## Community ‚ù§Ô∏è
Black Lives Matter. If you're a member of the BIPOC community or represent a non-profit in need of a website, I'd be glad to do that work for free. Just [get in touch](mailto:jamestedesco802@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]) and we'll make it happen!

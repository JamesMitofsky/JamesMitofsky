## What I do 🎸
I love web-development for its sharability, and — as could only be the case in the 21st century — I'm especially into the JAMstack and serverless functions.

## What I'm working on ✨
My most recently written site is [uvm.vote](https://uvm.vote), but I'm excited to switch [unwaitlist.io](https://unwaitlist.io/) from Azure to Firebase. Also, I recently bought a [Tessel 2](https://tessel.io/), so I'm pretty excited to see my code manifest in the physical world.

## Community ❤️
Black Lives Matter. If you're a member of the BIPOC community or represent a non-profit in need of a website, I'd be glad to do that work for free. Just [get in touch](mailto:jamestedesco802@gmail.com?subject=Looking%20to%20discuss%20website%20needs) and we'll make it happen!

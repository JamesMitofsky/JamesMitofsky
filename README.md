## What I do ðŸŽ¸
I love web-development for its sharability, and â€” as could only be the case in the 21st century â€” I'm especially into the JAMstack and serverless functions.

## What I'm working on âœ¨
My most recently written site is [uvm.vote](https://uvm.vote), but I'm excited to switch [unwaitlist.io](https://unwaitlist.io/) from Azure to Firebase. Also, I recently bought a [Tessel 2](https://tessel.io/), so I'm pretty excited to see my code manifest in the physical world.

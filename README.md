## What I do üé∏
I love web-development for its sharability, and as could only be the case in the 21st century, I'm especially interested in working with the JAMstack and serverless functions.

## What I'm working on ‚ú®
I've been projecting [unwaitlist.io](https://unwaitlist.io/) (a service for UVM students) since late 2019, but am currently looking to switch stacks from Azure to Firebase. Also, I recently bought a [Tessel 2](https://tessel.io/), so I'm pretty excited to see my code manifest in the physical world.

## Community ‚ù§Ô∏è
Black Lives Matter. If you're a member of the BIPOC community or represent a non-profit in need of a website, I'd be glad to do that work for free. Just [get in touch](mailto:jamestedesco802@gmail.com?subject=[Looking%20to%20discuss%20website%20needs]) and we'll make it happen!
